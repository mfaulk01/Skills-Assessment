Objective
----------
The objective here was to recreate a webpage that matched close to the './assets/mock.jpg'.

Outcome
-------
To be honest, I have never used node js, NPM or Gulp before so it was a little intimidating at first.  However, once I got everything downloaded it was fairly simple.  

My Javascript knowledge is not as high as my HTML and CSS skills are, so I opted out of the animation process.  

* Input all of the text and added the specified font and colors.
* Inserted the HERO image into the .wrapper using CSS
* Inserted the COLLAGE images using HTML
* Used margin and padding to lind all of the elemnents up as closely as possible 


Conclusion
-----------

This was a lot of fun, mainly due to the fact that I figured out how to use Gulp. Everyday I am always teaching myself new things about web design.  If hired, I guaruntee that my java and PHP skills will improve dramatically over the next few months.

Thank you for your time and consideration, I look forward to hearing from you.
